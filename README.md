           <h2> Our Project </h2>
           <h5>A connected wheelchair to track live workout data</h5>
           <p> Our project aims to support manual wheelchair users in maintaining an active lifestyle. We envision our project as a workout tracker, similar to existing commercial examples, such as NikeRun or FitBit, but adapted specifically to the physical properties of a manual wheelchair and the practicalities of its use. Using sensors, microprocessors and a Raspberry Pi, we connect the physical components of our system to a visual interface that shows users their workout progress and statistics in real-time. </p>

           <h2> Design Brief </h2>
           <h5>Connecting a wheelchair</h5>
           <p> “While the population of wheelchair users is growing worldwide, it becomes urgent to design supportive technologies that fit their needs. We aim to develop products for improvement of the wheelchair users’ wellbeing. This design is a connected product that collects data from sensors and processes it in order to actuate user interactions embedded in the wheelchair.”
                Building upon this brief, we envision our target user group as (either full- or part-time) manual wheelchair users aiming to work towards or maintain a healthier, more active lifestyle. Features of our connected product include location, distance and activity tracking (via GPS and accelerometer sensors), visualised through a UX interface, with the intention of developing a mobile app-based product.
